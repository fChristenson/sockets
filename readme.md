# Using websockets in a TypeScript application

## What we will cover

- What is a websocket?
- How do we structure our application to use them?

## Notes

Websockets is a communication protocol for sending realtime events between a client and a server.

They are very useful when we want to show realtime updates in a users browser such as when uploading something
or using a live chat app.
